TLDR: The next RustFest will be on the weekend of ???2020-11-07 and 2020-11-08??? and it will be an online community conference ðŸŽ‰

# Future<Output = RustFest::Global2020>

So how will it work?

## CfP for talks

The Call for Participation will be similar to the ones in the previous years, where we will start with a blind phase followed by a second round when a part of the team will see your names.

Please note that dropping your name will not help your talk to make the cut.

### Technical details

Over the next weeks we will test different setups.

## CfP for workshops

We are looking into how to make workshops reliable and fun for everyone.

Currently, we are testing good formats with the [ZÃ¼rich](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Zurich/) and [Berlin](https://berline.rs/) meetups.

So we will have a second 

## What are we looking for?

This is not the final list, it should give you some pointers:

* How to stay connected in your part of the rust community?
    * Do you reach out to new people?
* How do you learn about useful crates?
* Show off your cool feature/crate/contribution?
* Are you able to integrate rust in your day job? Or did you experience a missfit? 

Or to make it even shorter: What have you learned (with rust)?
 

## What to do in the meantime?

Attend meetups
