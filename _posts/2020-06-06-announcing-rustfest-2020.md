TLDR: The next RustFest will be on the weekend of 2020-11-07 and 2020-11-08 and it will be an online community conference ðŸŽ‰

# Future<Output = RustFest::Global2020>

So, how will it work?

## CfP for talks

The Call for Participation will be similar to the ones in the previous years, where we will start with a blind phase followed by a second round in which a part of the team will see your names.

Please note that dropping your name will not help your talk to make the cut.

### Technical details

Over the next weeks we will test different setups.

## CfP for workshops

We are looking into how to make workshops reliable, accessible and fun for everyone.

Currently, we are testing good formats with the [ZÃ¼rich](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Zurich/) and [Berlin](https://berline.rs/) meetups.

So we will have a second CfP for the workshops once we decide on a specific format.

## What are we looking for?

This is not the final list, it should give you some pointers:

* How to stay connected in your part of the rust community?
    * Do you reach out to new people?
* How do you learn about useful crates?
* Show off your cool feature/crate/contribution?
* Are you able to integrate rust in your day job? Or did you experience a misfits? 

Or to make it even shorter: What have you learned (with rust)?
 

## What to do in the meantime?

With the global lock down: Attend online meetups.

As mentioned before [Berlin](https://berline.rs/) and [ZÃ¼rich](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Zurich/) and many others are open to anybody on the planet to talk about a subject.

### Speaker preparations

If you plan to submit a talk or a workshop for this or any other conference, why not record yourself talking about something for 5 minutes.

This will allow you to see how the recording quality is.
Pro Tip: If you want to invest in something, start with brighter lights. 
Buying any LED bulb (usually with the E27 fitting) with more than 1000 lumen and a colour of 2500 to 2700 Kelvin for less than 20â‚¬ will have more effect than a fancy webcam that costs way more money.
Plus you can use the bulb as a normal light too.
