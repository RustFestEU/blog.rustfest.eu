Barcelona, a sunny city on the Mediterranean sea, capital of Catalonia, the land of *castellers* and *pà amb tomaca*, is considered one of the top tech hubs in Europe as it’s holding more than 1300 startups and generating almost 14000 jobs.

As a touristic destination, Barcelona is known for its beautiful architecture like Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, Ciutadella’s park and Palau de la Musica; for its delicious gastronomy and for its multicultural and open personality.

There are lots of ways to enjoy the city: you can go to the beach, have a hike on some green areas like Park Güell or just take a walk through the different neighborhoods in order to experience how the influence of History has affected the city.

## Save the date!

We have finally a date for this year's edition!

Rustfest 2019 will start on **November 9th** (Saturday) and will end on **November 12th** (Tuesday).

As usual, this edition will have two first days full of talks and workshops and two additional days (*aka Impl Days*) where you will be able to get together with other rustaceans, meet in smaller groups and work on your own community projects.

## Mixing things a little bit

Although we are keeping the same length in terms of days we have decided to change things a little bit and try something different.

This year, the conference format will change and instead of a first day of talks and a second day of workshops we're going to try to split the days into talks in the morning and workshops in the afternoon.

We took into account the feedback we received from previous editions and we believe this can work well for most of you. Indeed, this will allow us to have more talks and workshops and reduce the intensity of a monothematic format day.

## Venue

Rustfest Barcelona 2019 is going to be hold in the [Vèrtex building at Campus Nord](https://www.upc.edu/campusnord/ca/espais/auditori) belonging to [UPC - Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

![Vèrtex Auditorium](/assets/posts/barcelona-vx_auditori.jpg)

We'll be using the two level **Vèrtex auditorium** with capacity for 477 people and access for people with reduced mobility at any of the two levels which we think will make a great venue for the amazing talks we'll be hosting this year. ;D

The workshops and the *Impl Days** will take place in some of the [university's classrooms](https://www.upc.edu/campusnord/ca/espais/aules-vertex) which are fully equiped to host workshops of almost any kind.

We will have also available a chilling area for resting between sessions.

The venue is wheelchair accessible over the lateral street and can be reached easily by public transport. For more information about accesss for people with a disability in Barcelona you can take a look at [this link](https://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/transport/disabled/access-barcelona-disabled.html).

The best options to get there, if you come from Sants Estació, are the [Av. Pedralbes - Cavallers bus station](https://goo.gl/maps/QeNjywZ749Njur8S8) and the [Av d’Esplugues - Av Pearson bus station](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sants%2BEstaci%25C3%25B3,%2BBarcelona/Av%2Bd%27Esplugues%2B-%2BAv%2BPearson,%2B08034%2BBarcelona/@41.386477,2.1192745,15z/data%3D!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x12a4987e1c029355:0xb19606f1fb16429e!2m2!1d2.1409712!2d41.3816151!1m5!1m1!1s0x12a4984e1e97de21:0x992b87b41d670e10!2m2!1d2.111625!2d41.3921394!3e3!5i3!5m1!1e2&sa=D&ust=1562873148055000&usg=AFQjCNE1co3JRi_anes-tAbTSK8FFGFX4g); also there’s a subway option to [Palau Reial station](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/4u1dJbpRUHRrrmxE8&sa=D&ust=1562873148056000&usg=AFQjCNHwY0Vd1hK9hNsxd68fmNxsLdHs1A) if you want a quicker route that will require some walk.

Anyway, don't worry, we will update our website soon with plenty of information on this regard, so stay tuned! ;P

## Catering

We will provide breakfast, coffee, drinks and lunch the first two conference days so you don't have to worry about looking for a restaurant.

We'll also have vegan and vegetarian options and, if you have other dietary needs, please just contact us and we'll be happy to help you.

For the *Impl Days*, it will be up to you to decide where to eat. But don't worry, we'll gather information about some good restaurants in the area and we will fill our website with it so you can experience the best of our great gastronomy.

## Ticket information

Two days of talks and workshops, two more days of open space and hacking, breakfast, coffee, drinks and meals... wait, this surely must be very expensive!

Nope! We have managed to get a reasonable ticket price thanks to the [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en) venue and our sponsors!

The price for the tickets will be:

- 50€ student ticket,
- 100€ standard ticket,
- 200€ supporter ticket.

If you are a student or you belong to an underrepresented community, there will be a scholarship programme where you can apply for free tickets, travel and accomodation, too.

So, basically, money hopefully won't be a reason not to come! ;)

## Free RustBridge workshop

As usual, we'll also be hosting at least one [RustBridge workshop](https://rustbridge.com/) (probably two :P) so if you want to learn Rust, join the community and you belong to underrepresented communities and probably have a background in another programming language this is the perfect workshop for you. That being said, note that this is an open workshop for beginners and everybody is welcome to attend.

## Call for papers

Stay tuned for more information on this regard in the coming weeks! We're looking forward to reading your amazing proposals for this Barcelona edition!
