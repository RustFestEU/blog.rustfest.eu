Barcelona, a sunny city on the Mediterranean sea, the capital of Catalonia, and the land of *castellers* and *pà amb tomaca*, is considered one of the top tech hubs in Europe as it’s holding more than 1300 startups, and generating almost 14000 jobs.

As a touristic destination, Barcelona is known for its beautiful architecture like [Sagrada Familia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), [Casa Batlló](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_Batll%C3%B3), [Ciutadella’s park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_de_la_Ciutadella) and [Palau de la Musica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau_de_la_M%C3%BAsica_Catalana); for its [delicious gastronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_cuisine) and for its multicultural and open personality.

There are lots of ways to enjoy the city: you can go to the beach, have a hike on some green areas like [Park Güell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_G%C3%BCell) or just take a walk through the different neighborhoods in order to experience how the influence of [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Barcelona) has affected the city.

## Save the date!

At last, we have a date for you!

Rustfest 2019 will take place over the weekend of **November 9th-10th** (Saturday-Sunday), with **impl days following** on Monday and Tuesday, as usual.

This edition will have two first days full of talks and workshops, followed by the two additional (optional) days of *Impl Days*, where you will be able to get together with other rustaceans, meet in smaller groups and work on your own community projects.

## Mixing things up a little bit

Although we are keeping the same length in terms of days, we have decided to change things a little bit and try something different compared to previous years.

This year, the conference format will change, and instead of a first day full of talks and a second day full of workshops, we'll try to split the days in two different parts, with talks in the morning and workshops in the afternoon.

We took into account the feedback we received from previous editions, and we believe this can work well for most of you. Indeed, this will allow us to have more talks and workshops and reduce the intensity of a monothematic format.

## Venue

Rustfest Barcelona 2019 is going to be
in the [Vèrtex building at Campus Nord](https://www.upc.edu/campusnord/ca/espais/auditori) belonging to [UPC - Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

![Vèrtex Auditorium](/assets/posts/barcelona-vx_auditori.jpg)

We'll be using the two level **Vèrtex auditorium** with capacity for 477 people and access for people with reduced mobility at any of the two levels, which we think will make a great venue for the amazing talks we'll be hosting this year ;D

The workshops and the *Impl Days* will take place in some of the [university's classrooms](https://www.upc.edu/campusnord/ca/espais/aules-vertex) which are fully equipped to host workshops of almost any kind.

We will also have a chilling area to take some rest between sessions, a quiet room, and free childcare service.

The venue is wheelchair accessible over the lateral street, and can be reached easily by public transport. For more information about accesss for people with a disability in Barcelona you can take a look at [this link](https://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/transport/disabled/access-barcelona-disabled.html).

The best options to get there, if you come from Sants Estació, are the [Av. Pedralbes - Cavallers bus station](https://goo.gl/maps/QeNjywZ749Njur8S8) and the [Av d’Esplugues - Av Pearson bus station](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sants%2BEstaci%25C3%25B3,%2BBarcelona/Av%2Bd%27Esplugues%2B-%2BAv%2BPearson,%2B08034%2BBarcelona/@41.386477,2.1192745,15z/data%3D!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x12a4987e1c029355:0xb19606f1fb16429e!2m2!1d2.1409712!2d41.3816151!1m5!1m1!1s0x12a4984e1e97de21:0x992b87b41d670e10!2m2!1d2.111625!2d41.3921394!3e3!5i3!5m1!1e2&sa=D&ust=1562873148055000&usg=AFQjCNE1co3JRi_anes-tAbTSK8FFGFX4g). There is also an option through the subway with an stop at [Palau Reial station](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/4u1dJbpRUHRrrmxE8&sa=D&ust=1562873148056000&usg=AFQjCNHwY0Vd1hK9hNsxd68fmNxsLdHs1A) if you want a quicker route that require walking a bit.

We will update our website soon with more information.

## Catering

We will provide breakfast, coffee, drinks and lunch (vegan and vegetarian options) for the first two conference days, so you don't have to worry about looking for a restaurant.

For the *Impl Days*, it will be up to you to decide where to eat. We'll gather information about some good restaurants in the area and provide a list of options on our website, so you can experience the best of Barcelona's great gastronomy.

## Ticket information

When RustFest started three years ago (holy cow, it's been three years!) it was a small, cozy, simple event. In the following years we have doubled in size, visited various corners of the continent, and have been adding side events and implementing a variety of features to make RustFest even more awesome, enjoyable and accessible. While all this happened, one of our tenets of keeping RustFest accessible was keeping the ticket price down, to avoid making RustFest something that only a select few could afford, or only those whose employer were paying. We wanted everyone to be able to experience RustFest and not feel bad about spending a lot of money on something that might have been only a hobby, or matter of curiosity to them. We have added and continuously improved our Scholarship programs to provide even more opportunities to participate.

With that, it wasn't just RustFest that grew—our budget requirements have also doubled. With partnerships & sponsorships we always managed to break even, but going forward we would like to better distribute the load of keeping RustFest accessible among our attendees. This means we are revamping our ticket policy, centered around our new **Community** and **Full-price** tickets.

- **[Full-price Tickets](https://ti.to/rustfest/barcelona2019#tito-ticket-mmmjdodthnc)** are sold for **€250**, which is roughly what it takes to cover all costs of organizing a conference, distributed among our ticket holders. This includes speaker travel, A/V, scholarships, beyond the more immediate costs…
- **[Community Tickets](https://ti.to/rustfest/barcelona2019#tito-ticket-rxmlza19pya)** on the other hand remain to be sold for **€100**, which roughly covers the direct costs (venue rental and meals) of one attendee. These tickets are subsidized by our sponsors and other ticket sales.

We didn't want to make this any more complicated than it absolutely needs to be, so our Community Tickets are available in Tito for anyone to purchase, just as our Full-Price Tickets — but we ask those of you who can afford the Full-Price tickets, or whose tickets are paid or reimbursed by their employer to choose the Full-Price ticket and help us in organizing great conferences in the years to come. The number of Community Tickets are limited, but in case they sell out fast, you will be able to sign up to the waitlist and we may release more of them if we can be sure our budget can take it.

Also, just like in previous years, you will again be able to get an extra 50% discount on top of the reduced Community Ticket price if you are currently enrolled in an education institution, just add the **`STUDENT`** discount code before your checkout. This discount is also limited to a handful of tickets — and don't forget to bring along your student ID to the conference!

## Mini-Sponsorhip Tickets

Something new this year! Do you know of others from your company who were also planning to join us at RustFest? You can now buy a Mini Sponsorship ticket straight from our Tito page, that not only gets you two full tickets to the conference, but comes with extra perks, such as company logo placement and you are directly supporting our Scholarship fund!



## Free RustBridge workshop

As usual, we'll also be hosting a [RustBridge workshop](https://rustbridge.com/).
RustBridge is a workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community.

## Call for papers

Stay tuned for more information on this regard in the coming weeks! We're looking forward to reading your amazing proposals for this Barcelona edition!
