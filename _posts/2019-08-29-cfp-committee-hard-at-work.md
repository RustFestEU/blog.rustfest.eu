Our selection process has three steps.
Today we are at step one.

## Anonymous review

After having received your 🗐 proposals 🗐 we are looking at:

* XXX normal talks
* XXX short talks
* XXX workshops

## Open review 📃

After that we look at the best proposals with the names.
In this step we look at diversity and if one persons has multiple proposals in the running and a balanced selection for the conference.

This step concludes with one long call where the proposals are split into accepted, waitlisted and rejected.

Waitlisted means that we would have loved to accept your talk, but do not have enough time slots to do so.

## Confirming with speakers 📄

Finally, we try to confirm with the speakers.
Sometimes a accepted speaker can not make it or does not confirm the talk.
So waitlisted proposals get promoted.

Rarely a speaker gets ill and we do replace the talk with a waitlisted one if the speaker is onsite on short notice.
