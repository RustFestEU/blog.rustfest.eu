## RustBridge workshop

As it is a tradition now, we're hosting a [RustBridge workshop](https://rustbridge.com/).

> RustBridge is a workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community.

The workshop will take place on both conference afternoons: **Saturday, November 9th** and **Sunday, November 10th**.
Attendance is free, but we only have limited space.

## More workshops

We have many more workshops lined up this year.
You can find the full list [on the workshops page](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/workshops/).

Two of the workshops will run across both days, so to get the most of it plan to be around for both parts.
The other workshops are only running on a single afternoon, so you are able to attend two workshops.
All workshops are in the same venue as the conference talks, so after lunch it will be just a short walk to the next room to attend your favorite workshop.

We're also providing space for meeting fellow Rustaceans and chatting and hacking on your own.

As we have only limited space per room for the workshops, we will follow shortly with a way to signup for individual workshops.
