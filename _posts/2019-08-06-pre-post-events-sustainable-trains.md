## The big plan

What if you could meet with other rusteacens while you travel to and from RustFest Barcelona?

So what do we need for that?

1. Is there a path to go by train?
2. How far can you go in one day?
3. Which stops are interesting?

### Tools

For northern Europa:
* Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden -> [Deutsche Bahn](https://bahn.de)
* Switzerland, France, Spain -> [Schweizer Bundes Bahn](https://sbb.ch)

## Pre-Events

These events are timed so that people traveling towards Barcelona can stop by.
What does that mean, let's go through a possible option:
