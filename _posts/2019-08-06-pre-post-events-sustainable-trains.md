## The big plan 🚆

What if you could meet with other rusteacens while you travel to and from RustFest Barcelona?

So what do we need for that?

1. Is there a path to go by train?
2. How far can you go in one day?
3. Which stops are interesting?

### Tickets or Interrail

Usually people buy tickets from A to B, sometimes by locking in on a single connection.
However, a travel of this size is different.

When traveling huge distances over many countries sometimes delays happen or a train might break down.
With a regular ticket you have to find staff and organize a reroute on the spot.

This is where Interrail saves the day.
With the Interrail global pass you buy travel days over a period of time.
So you can simply catch the next train and continue your journey.

Eg. buy 7 travel days within one months.
So you have the flexibility to ride any train outside of your home country on 7 days.
In addition, the ticket is also valid for travel in your country of residence during one outbound journey and one inbound journey that occur during travel days at any point in your trip.

Most high-speed and night trains require a [reservation at an additional cost](https://www.interrail.eu/en/plan-your-trip/reservations).

For most European citizens [the Interrail pass (currently 10% off)](https://www.interrail.eu/en/autumn-sale/global-pass) is probably the most flexible and affordable ticket.
For [Non-EWR citizens](https://www.interrail.eu/en/help/ordering-pass/do-i-need-interrail-or-eurail-pass) there is [Eurail](https://www.eurail.com/en/eurail-passes/global-pass).
