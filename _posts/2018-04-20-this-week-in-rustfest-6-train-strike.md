# Strike

It is spring or as the french call it: "strike season"

If you live outside of France, you might be wondering:

* Who is on strike?
* How will this impact me?
* Will I have to walk from the French border to the venue in Paris?

Please keep in mind that the situation may change over time and that the information is to the best of our knowledge today 2018-04-20.


## SNCF: Trains

The French railway company SNCF is on strike.
And because caufeurs love time tables they made one for their current thre month strike:

In the plan are blocks of 3 days where you should not expect any train to run.
Currently about 40% [citation needed](https://de.oui.sncf/de/train/streik) of TGV run during a strike day, however it is nearly impossible to say which routs they will serve and the chanche of makeing a whole connection reduces with every hop you have to take.
E.g. to catch two connecting trains your chanches are 40% * 40% * 40% = 6.4%

Luckily there are two or three days between the strike blocks where you can expect the trains to run unless:

- ... you are traveling on an evening before a strike. So make sure that your train arrives in Paris *before 17:00 that day.

### What else is there to know?

Will prices rise? no

Can I ask for a refund? Well that depends on who sold you the ticket and how
- What methods of transport are affected/available?

### How to avoid stress

Bring an (offline) dictionary, talk to people and learn some french.
Also a big plus of traveling by train is that you are allowed to carry liquids like a bottle of wine or two.


## Metro System

It is allmost never on strike.
So even during the strike days of others the metro will run.

## Plane Strike

The plains strike too?
No actually it is the staff working inside the airport controll towers
