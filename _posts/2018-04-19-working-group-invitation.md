If you're a RustFest regular you may recall that last year our friends at 1aim offered conference tickets to some participants in the Libz Blitz. This year they reached out to us regarding supporting more of our community getting to RustFest. But the big question was "How!?"

You may recall as part of [the 2018 roadmap (RFC 1728)](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2314) and other community efforts multiple working groups have been formed around different topics. Yann, 1aim's co-founder, reached out to these working groups and spoke with them about how to best support the teams and support contributors.

## What is a Working Group?

[Working groups](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-2018-domain-working-groups/6737) are assemblies of contributors. Working Groups work directly with the Core Team and focus on the imporving the end-to-end user experience of using Rust in their respecitve domain. That work can involve the language, compiler, libraries, tools, documentation, discoverability, and more! The overall effort is organized by Aaron Turon (`aturon`).

* [Networking services](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-network-services-working-group-wg-net/7354), lead by `withoutboats` and `cramertj`
* [WebAssembly](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/come-join-the-rust-and-webassembly-working-group/6845), lead by `fitzgen`
* [CLI apps](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-cli-working-group/6872), lead by `killercup`
* [Embedded devices](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-embedded-devices-working-group/6839), lead by `japaric`

We have also seen other groups forming such as the [Formal Verification](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-formal-verification-working-group/7240), [Traits](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-traits-working-group/6804) and [Rust Compiler Performance](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rust-compiler-performance-working-group/6934) working groups. Maybe we'll even see more form!

You can also contact **your lead** or **Yann from 1aim (`Yann` on irc.mozilla)** directly with questions.

### A little bit about our friends over at 1aim

**[1aim](https://1aim.com/)** is redefining how buildings work and how we relate to the objects around us. They’re a people-centric company that combines excellence in mechanical, electrical and software engineering with an intelligent approach to design to create the best access control systems ever built. Each product has hardware, software and server infrastructure components. All product development is done in-house. Their flagship product is LightAccess Pro, the access control solution of the future. 

In addition to 1aim’s sponsorship of **Rust Fest** last year, CTO **Yann Leretaille**, who's also the system architect, delivered a keynote presentation. **And good news**: They’re **[actively looking](https://1aim.com/#careers)** to expand their team of developers to support their **Rust-powered backend**.

Based in Berlin, their founders are also founding members of the **[Good Technology Collective](http://goodtechnologycollective.com/)**, a group working to create awareness of the need for intelligent design and a global algorithm-literacy effort.
