RustFest Paris is happening next week! We are very excited to share our finalized
program for the conference day on Saturday and the workshops on Sunday.

# Our Sponsors

RustFest Paris is sold out, and looks like it will be the largest RustFest so far. 
Such an event would not be possible without the generous support of sponsors.
We are very humbled to have these great partners as our Platinum, Gold, and Silver sponsors:

We are also indebted to our Bronze level sponsors, *Baidu X-Lab* and *PingCap*.
