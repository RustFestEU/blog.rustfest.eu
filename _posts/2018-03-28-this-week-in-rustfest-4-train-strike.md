# Strike

Who is on strike?

## SNCF: Trains

This month we learned about SNCF

- Normal days
- What happens on strike days?
    - Will prices rise?
    - What methods of transport are affected/available?

## Plane Strike

The plains strike too?
No actually it is the staff working inside the airport controll towers
