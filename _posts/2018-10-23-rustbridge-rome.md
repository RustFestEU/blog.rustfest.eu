We are very happy to announce that the **RustBridge workshop** will return for RustFest Rome! 

> RustBridge is an all-day workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community. In this workshop weâ€™ll get you up and running with a Rust development environment, introduce you to Rust syntax and programming concepts, and work together to build a small website that you can personalize, extend, and share!

More information can be found [on the RustBridge website][rustbridge]. The workshop takes place on *Sunday, November 25th*, and will be led by [Olivia Hugger](TODO) and [?](TODO).

RustBridge has almost become a tradition at RustFest, with it being successfully held at all our previous conferences. And best of all: *Access to this workshop is free and does not require a conference ticket*. However, we kindly ask you to sign up using the provided form here:
