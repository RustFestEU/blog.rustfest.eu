# Speakers, Speakers, Speakers!

Readers last weeks' TWiRF will know that we announced our first speakers on Twitter this week. Besides our [already announced keynote speakers](https://blog.rustfest.eu/this-week-in-rustfest-3-cfp-keynote-speakers#keynote-speakers), we are very lucky to have 10 excellent speakers in Paris. The abstracts of the first few talks are already available [on our website](https://paris.rustfest.eu/talks/), more will follow very soon! Make sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rustfest) to not miss any.

# Emcee (Master of Ceremonices)

After his great performance at RustFest Zurich, we just had to invite the amazing **Andre 'llogiq' Bogus** back again for Paris. He is an excellent musician and bard (you can enjoy his `#rustlang` limmericks on Twitter!), we are very excited to see what he comes up with next!
