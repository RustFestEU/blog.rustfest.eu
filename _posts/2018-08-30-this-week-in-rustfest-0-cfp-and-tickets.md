# The CfP is open!

The [Call for Proposal](https://cfp.rustfest.eu) is open! We would love to hear your proposal for a talk. Make sure to submit before **September 16, 23:59:00 UTC**! As always, we'll be prioritizing talks not yet recorded at Rust conferences.

You are free to talk about anything Rust-related, come and share your own personal Rust experience! From code, to community and not forgetting experiences in production, best practices, theory or anything in between. We are happy to hear it from you.

First time speaking? Submit! It’s totally okay! If we accept your talk in our (blind) selection procedure we’re happy to be your first experience. If you’d like, we’re also happy to mentor you to give you some tips.

This year for the evaluation of the CfP will be done by a committee of community members .....
