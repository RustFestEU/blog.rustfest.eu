# CFP

The [Call for Proposal](https://cfp.rustfest.eu) is open! We would love to hear your proposal for a talk. Make sure to submit before **September 16, 23:59:00 UTC**! As always, we'll be prioritizing talks not yet recorded at Rust conferences.

You are free to talk about anything Rust-related, come and share your own personal Rust experience! From code, to community and not forgetting experiences in production, best practices, theory or anything in between. We are happy to hear it from you.

First time speaking? Submit! It's totally okay! If we accept your talk in our (blind) selection procedure we're happy to be your first experience. If you'd like, we're also happy to mentor you to give you some tips.

This year for the evaluation of the CfP will be done by a committee of community members! More news will come soon!

# Supporter conference tickets

From now on you can buy [Supporter Tickets to RustFest Rome (244€ inc. VAT)](https://ti.to/asquera-event-ug/rustfest-rome-2018)! Secure your place and make the conference more awesome!

Supporter tickets enable us to provide a great conference experience while keeping the ticket price affordable for everyone. By buying the Supporter ticket (priced at 244€ inc. VAT) you help us improve the conference, provide transcription, video recordings, on-site childcare etc.

Just like previous events we will do our best to support underrepresented groups by arranging travel, accommodation, and tickets for them by working with [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) again. The application will open soon!

We will be also releasing the student and standard in September. Be patient!

# `impl Days for RustFest<Rome>`

In Zürich and Paris we extended the conference for two days of open hacking and development. 

We plan something similar for Rome in the two days after RustFest Rome. If you would like to join us please book your hotel until the 26th or 27th of November. Yes, your conference ticket includes the impl days.
