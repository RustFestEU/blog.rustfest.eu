# CfP Progress

Thank you all for your 74 talks and 8 workshop submissions.
If you remember [our post from beginning of march](/this-week-in-rustfest-1-anonymouse-abstract-first-batch-locals) we are currently in the stage "The selection".

This means we have a preliminary schedule featuring:

| Kind of talk  | amount planed |
| ------------- | -------------:|
| Keynote       | 2             |
| 15min format  | 2             |
| 30min format  | 9             |

_Over the next days we will will be reaching out to selected speakers and finalizing the schedule._

## Workshops

Currently we are gathering more space for the workshops.
We will inform you as quickly as possible when we know who we can host.

## Diversity sponsorships

Thank you for all your submissions! Our team is currently reviewing the applications and we hope to get a response out to every applicant by end of next week (April 7).

We will be giving away a total of 15 free RustFest tickets for applicants, and distributing our scholarship fund among submissions for the travel stipends. For those who haven't applied but have the means to support us, this would be an excellent time to [contribute to our Diversity Fund](https://ti.to/asquera-event-ug/rustfest-paris-2018/) and help us support even more wonderful folks in attending RustFest this year! ðŸ’–


# Keynote Speakers

With the `edition = "2018"` (formally epoch) coming up the [rust core](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html) focuses on productivity.
That is why we are very excited to announce Matt talking about the community in Nairobi, Kenya and Vaidehi talking about the basics of computer science in a beginner friendly way.

## Matt Gattou

Matt is a software developer at [JUMO.world](https://jumo.world/) in Nairobi. He has a passion in building tech for social impact.
He is also the co-organiser of [Rust Nairobi](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Nairobi/), and hopes to make the tech industry a better place by encouraging learning and mentorship in his community.
He plays tennis and is a big scrabble fan.


## Vaidehi Joshi

Vaidehi is an engineer at [Tilde](http://www.tilde.io/), in Portland, Oregon, where she works on [Skylight](https://www.skylight.io/). She enjoys building and breaking code, but loves creating empathetic engineering teams a whole lot more.
