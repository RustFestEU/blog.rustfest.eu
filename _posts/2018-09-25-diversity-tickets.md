We have completely revamped our diversity programs and offerings, this year RustFest doubles up!

We are trying to keep RustFest as affordable as possible, but we understand that conferences could be a significant expenditure. Thus our Diversity Tickets program offers free tickets and a small 100 EUR travel reimbursement for members of underrepresented groups in tech!

ðŸ“¢ The applications for our Diversity Tickets program is open at [https://diversitytickets.org/events/257](https://diversitytickets.org/events/257).

The 100 EUR reimbursement might be enough to lift the burden of local or regional travel to RustFest Rome but, like previous years we also want to enable underrepresented folks for whom getting to RustFest is a bigger endeavor. This is the reason why we created our new Scholarship programs! Yes, programs, because for RustFest Rome we have launched two programs: our Diversity Scholarship and Disability Scholarships.

ðŸ“¢ Both scholarships are now open and accepting applications: [https://diversitytickets.org/en/events/258](https://diversitytickets.org/en/events/258).

Visit the above links to learn more about both Scholarship Programs and proceed to the [form to submit your application](https://scholarship.rustfest.eu)! Both our diversity tickets and scholarships applications close on <strong>October, 14th 2018</strong>, with some scholarships potentially be awarded awarded even before the deadline, on a rolling basis.

We want to take this opportunity and thank [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org), the [Ruby Monstas](https://rubymonstas.org) & [Travis Foundation](https://foundation.travis-ci.org) for being amazing long-standing partners in our diversity efforts, building excellent tools that helped us reach a much wider audience and thus ensuring that RustFest remains an inclusive and welcoming place for all! ðŸ’–
