This year we have completely revamped our diversity programs and offerings - here's a quick recap:

* To keep RustFest as affordable as possible, our Diversity Tickets program offers free tickets and a small 100 EUR travel reimbursement for members of underrepresented groups in tech!

    Applications for our Diversity Tickets program is available [here](https://diversitytickets.org/events/257).

* Like previous years we also want to enable underrepresented folks for whom getting to RustFest is a bigger endeavor. This is the reason why we created our new Scholarship programs! Yes, programs, because for RustFest Rome we have launched two programs: our <strong>Diversity Scholarship</strong> and <strong>Disability Scholarships</strong>.

    Both scholarships are accepting applications [here](https://diversitytickets.org/en/events/258).

Visit the above links to learn more about both Scholarship Programs and proceed to the [form to submit your application](https://scholarship.rustfest.eu)!

Keep in mind that both our diversity tickets and scholarships applications close on <strong>October, 15th 2018 at midnight</strong> ‚è≥.

We want to take this opportunity and thank [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org), the [Ruby Monstas](https://rubymonstas.org) & [Travis Foundation](https://foundation.travis-ci.org) for being amazing long-standing partners in our diversity efforts, building excellent tools that helped us reach a much wider audience and thus ensuring that RustFest remains an inclusive and welcoming place for all! üíñ
