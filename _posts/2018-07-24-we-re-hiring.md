## We're hiring

[RustFest](https://rustfest.eu) is the premier Rust conference in Europe. We aim to showcase what's happening in the Rust world, in all its diversity. Every RustFest happens at a different location, changing places every 6 months. RustFest is currently in the 5th iteration.

We partnered up with [Ruby Berlin e.V.](https://rubyberlin.org) and [OpenTechSchool e.V.](https://opentechschool.org) to fund a position for bookkeeping and event management. The bookkeeping part currently takes preference.

All projects take pride in their efforts to provide an inclusive environment and do active work to regularly improve on many levels.

Up until now, all of these projects were volunteer-run, meaning that many people would fulfill multiple roles. We found that bookkeeping and providing office services for people with simple inquiries would help us a out a lot.

Your job would include:
* Bookkeeping for RustFest (2 events per year)
  - Processing sponsor invoices
  - Processing reimbursements
  - Processing refunds for speaker tickets/diversity action
  - Yearly tax filings through a tax advisor
* Bookkeeping for Ruby Berlin e.V.
  - Processing invoices for Code Curious
  - Processing invoices for general e.V. business
  - Supporting the board
  - Yearly tax filings through a tax advisor
* Bookkeeping for OpenTechSchool
  - Processing Sponsorships
  - Processing invoices for general e.V. business
  - Supporting the board
  - Yearly tax filings
* Providing office services for all three
  - Answering general inquiries
  - Keeping in touch with sponsors

Note that both Ruby Berlin and OpenTechSchool don't have a large invoice volume, with most weeks going by with no work to be done. The position can be fulfilled remotely, we can provide office space if you prefer. All necessary materials (computer, etc.) can be provided.

All in all, we expect 30 hours of work per *month* for all three.

  - We've all been doing this for years, we roughly know what needs to be done

Based on your needs, we can:

Work on a contractual basis is initially preferred, although a full employment or a students position can be considered.
