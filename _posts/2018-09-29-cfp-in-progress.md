# Call for Proposals

Last week we closed the CfP (Call for Proposals) submission window, we allowed a couple more days to really give everyone a chance to submit.

We received 50 interesting proposals to fill up the talks slots for the upcoming Rustfest in Rome, thank you so much! Now it's our turn to open the envelopes and choose those that will make to the conference. As usual, the choice will be tough, all the topics submitted looks absolutely .

Like every year, there's a preliminary selection; here is a draft of the schedule, to be refined and finalez:

| Talk type     | amount planned |
| ------------- | --------------:|
| Keynotes      | 2              |
| 15min format  | 2              |
| 30min format  | 7              |
| 45min format  | 2              |

## Impl Days

What would a RustFest be without Impl Days! The Impl Days will take place on <strong>November, 26th-27th 2018</strong>. We are contacting possible venues to find a good spot to allow rustaceans enjoy the event and do something awesome together.
