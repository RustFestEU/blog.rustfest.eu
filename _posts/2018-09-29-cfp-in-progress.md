# Call for Proposals

Last week we closed the CfP (Call for Proposals) submission window, we allowed a couple more days to really give everyone a chance to submit.

We received 50 interesting proposals to fill up the talks slots for the upcoming Rustfest in Rome, thank you so much! Now it's our turn to open the envelopes and choose those that will make to the conference. As usual, the choice will be tough, all the topics submitted looks absolutely .

Like every year, there's a preliminary selection; here is a draft of the schedule, to be refined and finalized:

| Talk type     | amount planned |
| ------------- | --------------:|
| Keynotes      | 2              |
| 15min format  | 2              |
| 30min format  | 7              |
| 45min format  | 2              |

# Keynotes

We are excited to announce the line-up of the speakers for the keynotes:

### Aaron Turon

Rust Project lead, wine connoisseur and succulent appreciator.

### Ashley Williams

Ashley is an engineer at Integer32, contracting for Mozilla on the Rust Programming Language. She is a member of the
Rust Core team, leads the Rust Community Team, and is a member of the [crates.io](http://crates.io) infra and cargo
teams.

Previously, she worked as an engineer at npm, the package manager for Javascript, and currently is the Individual
Membership Director on the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

A long time teacher, Ashley has focused much of her energies on education programs for open source projects, founding
NodeTogether in 2016 and currently leading the RustBridge and Increasing Rust's Reach initiatives. She has represented
teachers' perspectives at TC39 meetings to influence the growth of JavaScript and continues to be passionate about
growing the web through her work on WebAssembly.

### Alan Kavishe

Alan is a software developer with a background in electronics engineering, who lives in Namibia and spends his days
coding Javascript and composing choral pieces. He saved his first program onto a cassette tape and then proceeded to pop
the tape into a stereo just to hear what it’d sound like. Turns out that’s a whole genre of music.

### Lee Baillie

Lee is currently wrangling the JavaScripts and herding the Rubies as an engineer at Tilde. Previously, they spent many
years drawing comic books to a limited but enthusiastic audience. They are just getting started at contributing to open
source projects and is already addicted. Please send help (don't actually send help).

## Impl Days

What would a RustFest be without Impl Days! The Impl Days will take place on <strong>November, 26th-27th
2018</strong>. We are contacting possible venues to find a good spot to allow rustaceans enjoy the event and do
something awesome together.
