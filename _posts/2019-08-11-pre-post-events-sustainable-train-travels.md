## The big plan ðŸš†

What if you could meet with other Rustaceans while you travel to and from RustFest Barcelona?
We want to make that happen and are organizing a community travel from the north of Europe all the way down to Barcelona, with stops in between.
We want to encourage more people to join us or plan similar travel events.

So what do we need for that?

1. Is there a path to go by train?
2. How far can you go in one day?
3. Which stops are interesting?
4. Where can I meet other people?

1 and 2 you have to answer for yourself.

3 and 4 we can help. We are [collecting all pre-/post events](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/pre_post_events/) on our website.

Beeing able to talk to your peers directly makes planning easy.
The [Rust User Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/c/community) is a great place to organize.

### Tickets or Interrail

Usually people buy tickets from A to B, sometimes by locking in on a single connection.
However, a travel of this length has some challenges.

When traveling huge distances over many countries sometimes delays happen or a train might break down.
With a regular ticket you have to find staff and organize a reroute on the spot.

This is where Interrail saves the day.
With the Interrail global pass you buy travel days over a period of time.
So you can simply catch the next train and continue your journey.

If you buy 7 travel days within one month, you have the flexibility to ride any train outside of your home country on 7 days.
So you have the flexibility to ride any train outside of your home country on 7 days.
In addition, the ticket is also valid for travel in your country of residence during one outbound journey and one inbound journey that occur during travel days at any point in your trip.

Most high-speed and night trains require a [reservation at an additional cost](https://www.interrail.eu/en/plan-your-trip/reservations).

For most European citizens [the Interrail pass (currently 10% off)](https://www.interrail.eu/en/autumn-sale/global-pass) is probably the most flexible and affordable ticket.
For [Non-EWR citizens](https://www.interrail.eu/en/help/ordering-pass/do-i-need-interrail-or-eurail-pass) there is [Eurail](https://www.eurail.com/en/eurail-passes/global-pass).

### Tools

Within Spain, Portugal, France:
* [Trenes](https://train.trenes.com/) (Don't forget to uncheck "Also search for accomodation")

Central Europa:
* [SNCF](https://www.sncf.com/en)

For Northern Europa:
* Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Switzerland, Serbia -> [Ã–BB](https://www.oebb.at/)
* Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland -> [Deutsche Bahn](https://bahn.de)
* Switzerland, France, Spain -> [Schweizerische Bundesbahnen](https://sbb.ch)

## The travel to Barcelona

Now let us look at some examples:

### Within Spain

From Madrid to Barcelona there are two kinds of trains traveling.

* A cheaper train that takes 9.5 hours.
* With the high speed train you can reach Barcelona in 2.5 hours.

* From Sevilla Santa Justa you travel directly to Barcelona within 5.5 hours.

### From France or Portugal

From most bigger cities of France you can reach Barcelona within 7 to 9 hours.

* From Paris, there is a direct TGV connection 3 times a day.
* From Rennes, take the TGV via Nimes.
* From Bordeaux, with InterCity and TGV via Narbonne.

* From Lisboa Estacion Oriente there is a train to Madrid Chamartin. Since it is not a high speed train it takes 11 hours and you will probably need to continue on the second day.

Note that there is a [cheaper Interrail country pass](https://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes/one-country-pass/spain-passes) and you probably only need 3 days within 1 month.


### From the North

These events are timed so that people traveling towards Barcelona can stop by.
What does that mean, let's go through a possible option:

{:.layout-auto}
|              City               |    Day    | Departure | Arrival |                                           Notes                                           |

The NightJet 471 from Berlin rolls directly to ZÃ¼rich.


### From the East

If you are traveling from the East it might be possible to cross routes with folks from the North and join their travel.
Lucky us there is a direct connection from Budapest to ZÃ¼rich.
Let's look at it:

{:.layout-auto}
|        City         |    Day    | Departure | Arrival |                                          Notes                                          |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budapest-Keleti, HU | Wednesday | 20:40     | 08:20   | Jump on the NightJet and relax.                                                         |
| Vienna, AT          | Wednesday | 23:25     | 08:20   | Same train, has multiple stops in Austria.                                              |
| ZÃ¼rich HB, CH       | Thursday  |           | 08:20   | Time to walk a little in ZÃ¼rich, meet people and maybe hit a shower and day of hacking. |

Note that you can take a direct train from Warsaw or Prague to Vienna.

### From the South

We suggest two possible options from Italy. Italy basically has one "train backbone" that goes from South to North so you choose how many stops you want to do. For more options and ideas visit [https://www.interrail.eu](https://www.interrail.eu).

{:.layout-auto}
|     City      |    Day    | Departure | Arrival |                                                       Notes                                                        |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rome, IT      | Wednesday | 11:30     | 14:30   | Get a quick "FrecciaRossa" train to Milan.                                                                         |
| Milan, IT     | Wednesday | 15:05     | 22:30   | Get the "EuroCity" train to Marseille, France.                                                                     |
| Marseille, FR | Thursday  | 08:00     | 12:30   | You're in Marseille the whole night. Either sleep or meet witht friends for a night of hacking or an afterhour :-) |
| Barcelona, SP | Friday    |           | 12:30   | You're in Barcelona and you can rest a bit, visit the city and the following day you'll be cool for the Rustfets   |

**Second option**, with one more stop and less idle time:

{:.layout-auto}
|      City       |    Day    | Departure | Arrival |                                                 Notes                                                 |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rome, IT        | Wednesday | 16:00     | 23:30   | Intercity train to border with France. You have a quick night of sleep at Ventimiglia                 |
| Ventimiglia, IT | Thursday  | 05:30     | 06:20   | A quick stop, then go to Nice                                                                         |
| Nice, FR        | Thursday  | 07:00     | 11:00   | TGV (fast connection) to Valence. You have the whole day in Valence, it's a very nice city, enjoy it! |
| Valence, FR     | Friday    | 00:20     | 16:30   | You'll reach Barcelona and you'll have half a day in your hands to go around before Saturday          |


## The way home

Depending on how fast you need to go back you can decide to detour.
With the Interrail global pass you are free to change your plans on the go provided you have enough travel days.
