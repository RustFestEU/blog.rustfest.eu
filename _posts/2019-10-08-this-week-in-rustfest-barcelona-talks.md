We can't believe it, but it's true:

## RustFest Barcelona is officially sold out!

Last week we started announcing most of our talks.

Check out [our talks page](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/talks/) with all details.

## Workshops

This year both conference days (Saturday & Sunday) will be filled with talks in the morning and workshops in the afternoon.
We have a bunch of great workshops and amazing coaches confirmed and will release details on all of them in the coming week.
Check back here or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rustfest) for all information.

## Hotel codes

We're now a month away from the conference and if you haven't booked your trip yet, it's about time.
Maybe a [trip by train](https://blog.rustfest.eu/pre-post-conf-events-sustainable-train-travels)?
We put together more information about traveling to Barcelona on [our location page](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/location/).

If you still need accomodation we might have some small discounts in for you:

* Use the code `RUSTFEST` at the [Bonanova Park Hotel](https://www.hotelbonanovapark.com).
* Use the code `RUSTFEST19` at the [Arenas Atiram Hotel](https://www.atiramhotels.com).

Both hotels are in walking distance to the venue.
