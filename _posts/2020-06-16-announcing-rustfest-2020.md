The summary: ðŸŽ‰ We are now very happy to announce the next RustFest will happen as an online community conference on the weekend of 7th & 8th November (2020-11-07 and 2020-11-08) and it will be an online community conference! ðŸŽ‰

RustFest 2020 was planned to happen about now, in Utrecht, the Netherlands. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world and forced us to shelter at home we had to put a stop to planning a large in-person event.
The team still wanted to make something happen and we talked through several options.

We will publish more in the next two to three weeks here on our [blog](https://blog.rustfest.eu) and on [our twitter account](https://twitter.com/RustFest), stay tuned!


# Future<Output = RustFest::Global2020>

So, how will it work?

This RustFest will be the first that is completely online, and whereas we aim for the same setup and experience, some elements will be adjusted to be able to offer you the best online experience.

## Talks & Call for Proposals

RustFest Global will feature talks across a wide range of topics, just the same as our in-person events in the past had.
We will stream all talks and provide a way to interact with the speakers & other attendees. Of course the talks will also be recorded and be available after the conference.
The Call for Participation will be similar to the ones in the previous years, where we will start with a blind phase followed by a second round in which a part of the team will see your names.

We want you to speak at RustFest and explicitly encourage new speakers to talk about their projects, ideas & experiences.
We will provide further details on the CfP process in the coming weeks.

### Technical details

Over the next weeks we will test different setups.

## CfP for workshops

We are looking into how to make workshops reliable, accessible and fun for everyone.

Currently, we are testing good formats with the [ZÃ¼rich](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Zurich/) and [Berlin](https://berline.rs/) meetups.

So we will have a second CfP for the workshops once we decide on a specific format.

## What are we looking for?

We are looking for proposals that include, but are not limited to:

* How to stay connected in your part of the rust community?
    * Do you reach out to new people?
* How do you learn about useful crates?
* Show off your cool feature/crate/contribution?
* Are you able to integrate rust in your day job or did you run into obstacles? And how was the experience?

Or to make it even shorter: What have you learned (with rust)?
 

## What to do in the meantime?

While in-person events are still not possible we would like to suggest to follow these meetup-groups that are organizing online meetups and that you are able to attend from the comfort of your own home.

Feel free to contact them if you would like to present a subject or talk about Rust.

* [Berlin](https://berline.rs/)
* [Netherlands](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Nederland/)
* [ZÃ¼rich](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Zurich/)

Larger events are listed on [timetill.rs](https://timetill.rs/#/) with [rusty days](https://rusty-days.org/) coming up next.

### Speaker preparations

If you plan to submit a talk or a workshop for this or any other conference, why not record yourself talking about something for 5 minutes.
This will allow you to see how the recording quality is.

Pro Tip: If you want to invest in something, start with brighter lights. 
Buying any LED bulb (usually with the E27 fitting) with more than 1000 lumen and a warm colour (~2700 Kelvin) will probably improve quality than a fancy webcam will.
Plus you can use the bulb as a normal light too.
