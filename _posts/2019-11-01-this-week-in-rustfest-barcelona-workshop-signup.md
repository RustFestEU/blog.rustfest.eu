## Schedule

Our complete schedule is now online:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/schedule/"><strong>RustFest Barcelona Schedule</strong></a>
</div>

We're looking forward to 11 talks and a total of 12 workshops.

## Workshop signup

This year the workshops happen as afternoon sessions on both days.
We will have workshops that run on only one day and a handful of workshops that are spread across both days.

You can signup for one or two workshops online:

<div style="text-align:center">
<a href="https://ti.to/rustfest/barcelona2019/"><strong>Sign up for workshop tickets</strong></a>
</div>

Workshops don't cost extra and are included in the general conference ticket already.
So if you have a conference ticket, you are eligible to attend the workshops.

## Workshop topics

You can find the full list of workshops [on the workshops page](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/workshops/).

Since we last talked about it, we added two more workshops:

[**Sketching for faster learning and effective communication**](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/sessions/sketchnoting)

Ever seen sketchnotes at a conference, and wished you could communicate as clearly, and quickly?
Malwine will let you in on a secret: drawing is a teachable skill, just like writing code is.

Learn how to sketchnote to capture key points of a talk or conversation
and by the end of the day you will leave with new confidence and skills you can use the same day!


[**Bring your own Topic**](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/sessions/bring-your-topic)

Did you recently found out about a cool new project? Are you developing one of your own?  
On Sunday we give you a space to present your own topic in short lightning talks & demos.

Come by, bring slides, code or a question or listen in on what other Rustaceans are doing with Rust.
