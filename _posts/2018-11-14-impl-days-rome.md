# Location of the Impl Days Rome

This week in RustFest, we are super happy to confirm the location of the `impl Days for RustFest<Rome>`! 

The `impl Days` is a two-days event which took place for the first time at RustFest ZÃ¼rich. 30-40 people came together to [discuss, design, and implement changes](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-impl-period-newsletter-2/6034) to Rust itself as well its broader ecosystem. Earlier this year in Paris the `impl Days` grew even [bigger](https://twitter.com/MozillaParis/status/1001434063264272384) -- almost [90 people attended in 2 different venues and worked on over 85 pull requests and issues](https://bit.ly/impldays).

Naturally, we can't wait to welcome all of you back in Rome and see what [amazing](https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2017-10-02/?msg=91818378&page=2) [things](https://twitter.com/simukis/status/1001122476011802626) you will build this time! We have already announced the dates for the `impl Days` Rome earlier this year -- now we are happy to confirm the location too:
