Barcelona is a Mediterranean and cosmopolitan city with Roman remains, medieval quarters and the most beautiful examples of 20th century Modernism and avant-garde. The city's origins are Roman and as Rome, it also has 7 hills, so it kind of made sense to celebrate next RustFest edition here after last year's Rome edition. We hope you'll be able to join us and share with us our love for Rust and the community around it.

**What is Rustfest again?** It's a two day conference involving one day of workshops and one day of talks! We aim for a diverse set of talks: technical and non-technical, advanced and beginner friendly content, live coding, panel, or slide based. If you like Rust, the community, or just hacking in general we aim to have something to appeal to you. This year the conference will host up to 350 awesome folks. It occurs bi-annually in a different city each edition.

**Want to attend?** Mark your calendars! While we don't have a final date yet, we're aiming for late fall this year.
Like previous editions, we'll release a few ticket batches to ensure you get a chance to get your ticket. In the meantime, why not get to know Barcelona a bit? Check out the [venue page](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/location/) for more.

**Need to convince your boss?** Some talking points: RustFest is the leading non-US based conference focused on Rust and the community around it. We are a community conference with (very) affordable tickets, and we can issue invoices to companies.

**What is it like?** Talks can be found online for all past editions:

 The conference is much more than that though, and you'll have the opportunity to meet people who work on some of the projects and efforts you know and love.

**Want to speak?** The [Call for Proposals](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/) will open soon! We would love to hear your proposal for a talk. Stay tuned on the official RustFest communication channels such as our [twitter](https://twitter.com/rustfest) or this blog.

**Haven't spoken before but want to?** Submit! It's totally okay! If we accept your talk in our (blind) selection procedure we're happy to be your first experience. If you'd like, we're also happy to mentor you to give you some tips.

**Barriers to participating?** Not all of us can easily attend these events for a variety of reasons. We'll be working with [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) again. If the ticket cost itself is your only barrier, let us know. Read more on our [infos & policies](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/info/) page.

**Want to help someone else attend? Have a conference budget?** We will be selling supporter tickets as well, with the additional funds being used for inclusivity and diversity efforts. If you can, consider helping our fellow community members.

**Want to help organize?** If you'd like to be part of our organizing team please introduce yourself and let us know at [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu). We prefer if team members are interested in helping for multiple events, especially if you might be interested in helping bring a RustFest to your area.

So, we hope to see you soon in Barcelona! Keep hacking and don't be afraid of the compiler!
