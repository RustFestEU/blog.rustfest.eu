# Strike

Rust Fest will happen during a french strike.
Here is an assessment for the situtaiton to the best of our knowledge.

## Who is on strike?

Currently all the people working for the national train company SNCF and some of the people of Air France.

It is possible that more will start to strike depending on how the neogations between the unions and the government turn out.

## Why is there a strike?

What the people currently fight is the reduction of their social security system. 
However that issue hides the actual issue:

    The french are protesting the sellout of "service public" to the "open market".

This means the french government would like to remove 120'000 jobs over the next years (citation needed).

## When will there be a strike?

### SNCF: Trains

[SNCF](https://en.oui.sncf/en/train/strike) officially posted the strik schedule for April.
The extendes schedule runs until the end of June.

### AirFrance: Planes

The plains strike too?
No actually it is the staff working inside the airport controll towers.

## What else do I need to know?

- Open demonstrations?
- Travel times
- Alternative modes of transport
    - Taxi
