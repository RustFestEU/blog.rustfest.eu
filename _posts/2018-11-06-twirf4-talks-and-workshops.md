# Talks and Workshops at RustFest Rome

Last week, we finally announced the long awaited talks lineup for Rome on our Twitter account [@RustFest](https://twitter.com/RustFest) account. We also published a sneak peek of the schedule, which is now complete and available on our website: <a href="https://rome.rustfest.eu/schedule/"><strong>🎙️ Talk Schedule 🎙️</strong></a>

RustFest would of course not be RustFest without workshops. We already announced [**🌉 RustBridge**](https://blog.rustfest.eu/rustbridge-rome) as our first workshop a few weeks back. This week we are super excited to announce the remaining workshops we are having on Sunday:

  - [**📚 Effective Rust Documentation**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/sessions/effective-rust-documentation) by *Andre 'llogiq' Bogus*
  - [**📷 GTK and GStreamer**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/sessions/gtk-gstreamer) by *Guillaume Gomez* and *Sebastian Dröge*
  - [**🌍 Networking & Web**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/sessions/networking-web) by *Hoverbear* and *Yann Leretaille*
  - [**🚀 Parallel Programming**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/sessions/parallel-programming) by *Stefan Schindler*

# Our Friends at Kodebox

We are excited to have [Kodebox](https://codechain.io/) sponsor us for the first time in Rome!

Kodebox is a blockchain technology company focused on developing digital asset management solutions and services. Our project, [CodeChain](https://codechain.io/), is a programmable open-source blockchain technology written in Rust. It is optimal for developing and customizing multi-asset management systems. Developers who want to build their own blockchain network can leverage CodeChain’s pluggable architecture and make use of its codebase.

<a href="https://codechain.io" target="_blank">![Kodebox](https://rome.rustfest.eu/assets/sponsors/kodebox.png)</a>

Why advocate Rust? The biggest pain in developing a blockchain technology is that it’s really hard to make updates to the software once it is deployed. Fortunately, Rust’s advanced type system helps us write bug-free software. Rust is an ideal programming language for developing blockchain technologies.

  - Rust is memory-safe; the code can’t have dangling pointers, buffer overflows and other types of memory-related errors by design. With all these safety guarantees, it is still as fast as C/C++.
  - Rust’s support for concurrency is great.

Rust is at the core of our technology; advances in the language also means a more robust CodeChain. This is the reason why we are really excited to be at RustFest 2018 Rome and to meet people that love the technology we are so passionate about. We look forward to meeting you all at the talks and workshops, and discuss our experience of using Rust in CodeChain. Please, feel free to reach out to our team during the event!

If you are interested in becoming a full-time Rust developer, check out our source code on [github](https://github.com/CodeChain-io/codechain) and please, send your CV to [hi@kodebox.io](mailto:hi@kodebox.io). We always welcome great Rust engineers!
