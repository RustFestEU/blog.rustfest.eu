They say all the roads lead to Rome, so after previous successful stops in Berlin, Київ, Zürich and Paris, it was just a matter of time before RustFest reached the Italian capital. We hope you'll join us on  **November 24th and 25th, 2018** at [**Congress Center Frentani**](https://www.congressifrentani.it/centrocongressi/), near the main railway station of Rome ([Termini](https://www.romatermini.com/en/)).

**What is Rustfest again?** It's a two day conference involving one day of workshops and one day of talks! We aim for a diverse set of talks: technical and non-technical, advanced and beginner friendly content, live coding, panel, or slide based. If you like Rust, the community, or just hacking in general we aim to have something to appeal to you. This year the conference will host up to 350 awesome folks. It occurs bi-annually in a different city each edition.

**Want to attend?** Pencil the date in your calendar! Like previous editions, we'll release a few ticket batches to ensure you get a chance to get your ticket. In the meantime, why not explore hotel/AirBNB options as well as things to do? Check out the [venue page](https://rome.rustfest.eu/location/) for more.

**Need to convince your boss?** Some talking points: RustFest is the leading non-US based conference focused on Rust and the community around it. We are a community conference with (very) affordable tickets, and we can issue invoices to companies. 

**What is it like?** Talks can be found online for [Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI4RG_uq-WU&list=PL85XCvVPmGQh8nWR_Z-fTmPGsUWuzb-dn), [Київ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHprJNUCgQ0&list=PL85XCvVPmGQhvs1Rnet_24B-AI3YSM2YG), [Zürich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jywiVWKm1TI&list=PL85XCvVPmGQj9mqbJizw-zi-EhcpS5jTP) and [Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23lRkdDXqY0&list=PL85XCvVPmGQgdqz9kz6qH3SI_hp7Zb4s1). The conference is much more than that though, and you'll have the opportunity to meet people who work on some of the projects and efforts you know and love, share in  pizza, pasta and espresso with your new and old friends.

**Want to speak?** The [Call for Proposals](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/) will open soon!. We would love to hear your proposal for a talk. Stay tuned on the official RustFest communication channels.

**Haven't spoken before but want to?** Submit! It's totally okay! If we accept your talk in our (blind) selection procedure we're happy to be your first experience. If you'd like, we're also happy to mentor you to give you some tips.

**Barriers to participating?** Not all of us can easily attend these events for a variety of reasons. We'll be working with [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) again. If the ticket cost itself is your only barrier, let us know. Read more on our [infos & policies](https://rome.rustfest.eu/info/) page.

**Want to help someone else attend? Have a conference budget?** We will be selling supporter tickets as well, with the additional funds being used for inclusivity and diversity efforts. If you can, consider helping our fellow community members.

**Want to help organize?** If you'd like to be part of our organizing team please introduce yourself and let us know at [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu). We prefer if team members are interested in helping for multiple events, especially if you might be interested in helping bring a RustFest to your area.

So, we hope to see you soon in Rome! Keep hacking and don't be afraid of the compiler!
