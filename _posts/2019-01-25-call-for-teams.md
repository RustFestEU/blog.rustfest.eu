Ever since the very first RustFest we have never intended to keep the organizing team a small, strict, tight-knit group. During the years organizers came and went, and with them locations popped up: we always managed to inspire someone to give back to their own local communities by bringing the global Rust community to town. All this time our goals were to [teach and to empower](https://github.com/rust-community/foss-events-planner) - to leave every community RustFest touched with the ability and means of organizing larger events. Some of these people have also decided to stick with us, and now part of the wider RustFest organizing team.

After five wonderful events and having almost doubled the size of our very first event we have decided at last year's Rome event to take a step back and try to organize all our learnings in a way that we could use to help an even wider variety of global (or globally local) events to emerge.

Organizing two events a year -- especially in such a nomadic manner, when no two events are in the same place, or in the same country even! -- is hard, and we could already see some cracks showing.

We want to keep RustFest a high-quality community festival, a celebration of the Rust programming language and its wonderful (and wonderfully diverse) community. But we also want to contribute to this diversity by supporting, empowering and lifting up other communities and other event ideas emerging all around the globe.

2018 saw the first ever Rust conference in Moscow, Russia take place, and the trend is not slowing with Uruguay and China getting their own conferences soon. Supporting local initiatives and events is incredibly important when one is trying to grow a truly global community.

This brings us to today's announcement of the Call for Events (a.k.a Call for Event Organizing Teams):

> #### [The RustFest & Rust Community Events Team joint Call for Events form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gxAgOl4ug8RhGFmQoRScveLgNigb0Gc8BIX6ZZJLj5I/)

The above form is built in cooperation with the Events Subteam of Rust Project's Community team (which team itself includes many of the RustFest organizers themselves), and has two goals:

1. We at RustFest still haven't decided on where would our next event take place this fall. As with every RustFest we need an enthusiastic and determined local team who will work with us as we bring RustFest to their region. If this is something that interests you and some of your fellow community members, please let us know by filling out this form.

2. Even if you are not necessarily looking into organizing a RustFest-style conference, or maybe you are perfectly capable of organizing your event without any cooperation from our side, you might consider sharing with us the event, format or plans you have so we could support you. This support could be raising awareness, sharing sponsor contacts, best practices or anything that the Rust Events team or RustFest's team could help you with in making an amazing event for your local (or the international) Rust community.

Even if your plans are vague, or you *just* decided that you will do *something* by reading this blogpost, please by all means, get in touch via this form.

This form is not a filter, a selection form, there is winners or losers, this form is the first step in an ongoing conversation we plan to engage in with every submitter to ensure a vibrant, diverse, event-filled future for the language and community we all know and love.
