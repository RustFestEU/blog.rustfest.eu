    Call for Proposals
  </a>
</h3>

Starting today the [Call for Proposals](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/events/rustfest-barcelona-2019) is open!

We would love to hear your proposal for a talk. Make sure to submit before **August 19, 23:59 UTC**!
As always, we'll be prioritizing talks not yet recorded at Rust conferences.

You are free to talk about anything Rust-related, come and share your own personal Rust experience!
From code, to community and not forgetting experiences in production, best practices, theory or anything in between. We are happy to hear it from you.

First time speaking? Submit! It's totally okay!
If your talk will be selected in our (blind) selection procedure, we'll be happy for Rustfest to be your first experience on stage.

We're also happy to mentor you with tips and guidelines and offer to review your talk prior to the conference.

We're currently building up this year's CfP committee. Stay tuned for more news soon.

## CfP for workshops

We're also looking for some workshops.
With the changed format of the conference, we will have a few more, but shorter workshops.
We are looking for people hosting workshops on interesting topics all around Rust.

Workshops will be happening in the afternoon of both Saturday and Sunday.
Therefore workshops can be on a single afternoon, can be repeated on the second day or can potentially stretch across both days.
Please let us know what is more suitable for your proposal.

## Ticket sales

Last week we announced the dates and opened ticket sales.
We still have Full Price tickets on sale and we will open up a new batch of **Community Tickets on Thursday, July 25, 09:00 UTC**.
