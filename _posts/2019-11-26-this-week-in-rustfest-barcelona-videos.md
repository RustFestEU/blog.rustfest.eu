## Lightning talks & workshop material

This year we used one of the workshop slots for a round of lightning talks.
On Sunday afternoon we had a total of 13 different short talks in front of a filled room,
with topics such as Rust RFCs, code discussions, interesting crates and making music using Rust.

You can find the list of topics and the discussed projects [on the workshop detail page](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/sessions/bring-your-topic).
We also added links to the material for other workshops where we have it available. Check out the [list of all workshops](https://barcelona.rustfest.eu/workshops/).
