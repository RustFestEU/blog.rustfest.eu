This week in RustFest, we have two additional workshops for you! This brings us to a total of [**seven different workshops**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/workshops/) for you to choose from on **Sunday, November 25th**.

[**Writing Parsers and Cutting Corners**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/sessions/writing-parsers-and-cutting-corners) by Maciej Hirsz
<br>
or *How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love ASCII*
> Want to parse some JSON? How about a Lisp? Or maybe Yet Another Another Markup Language? Whatever the motivation, we got you covered! We will work with a very small language with a grammar written in Pest (which is amazing!), try to understand what it’s doing, and see if we can make a hand-written(-ish) parser from scratch that is faster then the Pest-based one. Then we will look through some ways to make that even faster.

[**Fastware**](https://rome.rustfest.eu/sessions/fastware) by Jack Fransham
> Rust is often touted as a fast language, but the Rust compiler isn’t magic. Although Rust enables and encourages an efficient style of programming, sometimes you need to dig deep and worry about the low-level details of your code. This workshop will teach you how to get the most out of your programs, without resorting to unsafety.
