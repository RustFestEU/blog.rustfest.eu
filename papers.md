title: Call for Papers
---


We're opening a total of **5-6 speaker slots**. Talks are 30 minutes long, including Q&A.

Rust is a new language so all papers are welcome. If you have been working on something for only 6 months, but it's interesting, then apply!

## Where do I head to?

Read the [Submission Guide](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/guide) and submit.

In the first instance our CFP selection process is based only on title and abstract.

## Mentorship

Rustfest has a Mentorship program. You will have a mentor assigned to you for your talk. See our [Mentorship Guide](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/mentorship) for details. To register as a mentor, just sign up and tick the box in your profile.

## Ideas

Check out this [Rust Community Talks repository](https://github.com/rust-community/talks) for inspiration.  Aside from looking at what other people have requested, here are some ideas:

- Rust for {Java,C++,C,Python,Ruby,Javascript,Scala,Haskell,C#,F#,whatever} developers
- Typical Rust gotchas or Rust for beginner programmers
- Understanding trickier bits of Rust the language (borrow checker, marker traits, trait objects, unsafety)
- What's new or coming up in the latest version of Rust (similar to http://this-week-in-rust.org/ )
- How to contribute to Rust community
- Demonstrate your/someone else's rust library X to solve problem Y
- Anything Cargo (tips, tricks, integration with other builds)
- The history of Rust (e.g. scrapped features, motivations, pivotal RFCs)
- Rust FFI/how to integrate with common C libraries
- Rust usage in a popular project (e.g. Servo, Piston, etc), or a project of your own (no matter how trivial!)
- Rust for gamedev/real-time/embedded systems
- How Rust and LLVM work together or how other bits of the Rust compiler work
- Embedding other languages in Rust, or embedding Rust in other languages
- Testing, benchmarking, profiling, debugging, REPL, IDE, editor experiences/tips/tricks/tools
- Stories about solving bugs, compilation errors, or production experiences

We will give more details once CFP opens.
